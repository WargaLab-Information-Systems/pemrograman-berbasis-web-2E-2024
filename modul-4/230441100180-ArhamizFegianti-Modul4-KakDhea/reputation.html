            Reputation (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on November 10, 2017, and her final album under Big Machine Records. Secluding herself from public appearances, Swift conceived Reputation as a response to the media scrutiny after her previous album, 1989 (2014), propelled her toward pop stardom.
